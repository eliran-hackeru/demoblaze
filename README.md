# UI Automation Testing Project - DemoBlaze
## Overview
This project is an automated UI testing framework using Selenium WebDriver and Cucumber to validate the core functionalities of an e-commerce website.
## Test Scenarios
The project includes the following test scenarios:
1. **Sign Up Tests** - Verifies that users can successfully sign up with new credentials.
2. **Login Tests** - Verifies that users can successfully log in with valid credentials.
3. **Navigation Tests** - Ensure users can navigate different product categories.
4. **Cart Tests** - Tests the ability to add and remove items from the shopping cart.
5. **Checkout Tests** - Confirms that users can complete the checkout process.
## The Reasoning Behind These Tests
The selected test scenarios cover the core functionalities of the e-commerce website, ensuring that essential user journeys work as expected. These tests serve as both Sanity and Regression checks:
* **Sanity Testing:** Quickly verifies that the website is functional after updates or deployments.
* **Regression Testing:** Ensures that new changes do not break existing features.
By covering **Sign-Up, Login, Navigation, Cart, and Checkout,** this suite guarantees that critical aspects of the website are working. These tests also act as a foundation for future expansion, allowing for more advanced scenarios as needed.
## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
* **Java** (JDK 8+)
* **Maven** (for dependency management)
* **Google Chrome** (for testing in Chrome)
* **ChromeDriver** (Ensure it's compatible with your Chrome version)
